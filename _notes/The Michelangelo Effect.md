The Michelangelo Effect explains the phenomenon when each partner in a couple forge or sculpt each other into a better version of themselves. We often see this in pop-movies when a girl improves the guyâ€™s style while the guy, for example, makes the girl pursue her dream job or hobby. Overall, it is a mutually positive reinforcement that benefits both of them.

You are the average of your friends around you. Which means that we all are influenced by people around us, but itâ€™s your partner who often has the greatest impact on you.

> *A healthy relationship is one in which you flourish as a human being. Furthermore, you can always be yourself without being forced to go against your core values and identity.*
>- I agree. Itâ€™s better to thrive in a relationship rather than deteriorate into an unknown state.
