*¬´ We should ideally balance our input and output through continuous creation. The information we consume should be turned into evergreen notes‚Äîusing our own words. ‚Äì Anne-Laure Le Cunff ¬ª*

When doing knowledge work, it‚Äôs important to balance your level of consumption and creation. Even If it‚Äôll cost your a number of articles that you want to consume.
Instead, add them to your read-it-later app till the moment you finish processing your existing notes or the one you were planing to develop. This will prevent you from being affected by [[Collector‚Äôs Fallacy]]. **Maxim Dorofeev** once talked about importance of practicing focus state through not thinking about anything and just sitting/lying on the bed/sofa. In some way, it‚Äôs also relevant to our problem: consuming too much. 

To break this vicious circle, once you have an abundance of notes in your Inbox, process them, distill them([[Progressive summarization]]), turn them into Evergreens([[1,2 Evergreen notes are]]).This will bring you to the point where your notes and your workflow will be in compliance with [[3 —Å—Ç–æ–ª–ø–∞ –æ–±—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è]] and [[Keep balance between theoretical and practical knowledge]].
