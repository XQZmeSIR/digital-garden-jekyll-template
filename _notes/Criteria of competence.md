I was having a shower and practicing speaking(pictured myself in a discussion) when this struck me:

One of the criteria of being competent in any subject is **hesitation when you speak about it.** Not because you don’t know stuff but on the contrary, because you do know. Therefore, it causes benevolent uncertainty that is a sign of you knowing something.

When you extensively read about something you always have that inner feeling of doubt when you speak about it. Whereas, arrogant and ignorant people are always trying to assert themselves in a way that might be inappropriate or wrong. They seem to not like to have a “conversation”.
