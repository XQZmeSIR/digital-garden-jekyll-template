### Evergreen notes are:
- written in [[Restate an idea in your own words to truly learn it. - Fork My Brain|your own words]]
- atomic, meaning each note should focus on one idea
- concept-oriented, meaning each note should focus on a concept rather than a book, author, project, etc
- and densely linked, meaning they should have lots of links to other notes.
