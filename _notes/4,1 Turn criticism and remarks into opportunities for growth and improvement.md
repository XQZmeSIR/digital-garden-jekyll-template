Part of being a person with [[Growth mindset or fixed mindset]] is that you constantly learn from mistakes and turn every critical remark into an opportunity that reveals you your flaws.
Someone said to you that you have bad reception or serve, don‚Äôt become furious. Instead, take it as a cue for further improvement.

Be composed. Pause, reflect and respond. Control your emotions. Be grateful for someone‚Äôs criticism, it will reveal your flaws.

It's similar to what Andrew Tate does nowadays. He seems to take all the criticism/remarks that his persona gets and he gets better at it. To verify this point let's take an example: Jordan Peterson have been talking about archetypes,  suffering, difficulties in life, and then, when Andrew became the most Googled man in the world, people started to ask him about Andrew Tate. Jordan abstained from discussing this topic but politely let the audience know that he isn't fond of Tate.

Presumably, Andrew saw that excerpt in the internet and he didn't comment about it as well. But what is interesting is that after some time he started using some of his terminology: archetype, suffering etc. as if he absorbed some of Jordan‚Äôs wisdom. **In other words, he listens to his opponents and adversaries and uses their strengths as his own.** Fascinating!

    - This is why, he continues, it is important not to react impulsively to events. It is essential to pause, take a moment and reflect on what has just happened before making a judgement about it.
    - If someone says something critical about you, stop to consider whether what they say is true or false. If it is true, then they have pointed out a fault that you can now address. As such, they have benefited you.
    - If what they say is false, then they are in error and the only one being harmed is them. Either way, you suffer no harm from their critical remarks. But the one way in which their remark could cause you a real and serious harm is if you were to let it provoke you into a state of anger.
