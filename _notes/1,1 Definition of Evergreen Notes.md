### Definition of Evergreen Notes

Evergreen notes are a fundamental unit of knowledge work developed by independent researcher **Andy Matuschak**, and they allow you to think about *complex ideas by building them up* from smaller composable ideas. They are written and organized in a way that allows them to become living entities, **gaining insights and complexity as more time passes**. The idea builds off many other note-taking philosophies like Niklas Luhmann's method and Sonke Ahren's system.

They're a way to build up a personal library of clear opinions, beliefs and original thoughts.
