According to [[Hebb‚Äôs Law]] and [[Long-term potentiation (LTP)]] when we do an activity and when we become better at it, our neuron connection become stronger causing a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength.

So whatever you do once, is easier to do a second, because of high-frequency stimulation of the connection between the two neurons. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as [[Hebb‚Äôs Law]] ^d5c949

That‚Äôs why [[Consistency and repetition]] is crucial in learning or elevating your performance.  **Even the subtle act of practicing** the volleyball movement whether it‚Äôs footwork or wrist training ‚Äì **can make a difference** because of [[Compound effect]](one reason).


More abstract view on that is [[Embodied cognition#^11eddc]] that also refers to our connection between the mind, body, and the environment AND our ability to EMBODY skills that we learn through [[Consistency and repetition]].
