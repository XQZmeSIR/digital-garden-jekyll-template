### Draft 📝
The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more *discoverable* for your future self* —by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it.

### Atomic Note💡
- In order to spend less on processing and analyzing your notes in the future, make them more **discoverable**.
- That means turning them into a form that'll be accessible and easily comprehensible in the future. How to achieve it? One way is [[Progressive summarization]].
	- ==Highlight== the most important parts
	- Use *layers* for highlighting as a Zoom in Map app
	- Use *bullets* or *Key Takeaway*
	- Follow the **campsite rule:[^1]** “*Leave it better than you found it*“
