### Atomic Noteüí°
- **Rustam Agamaliev** was asked about martial arts and his answer, particularly about [[Kyokushin]] style of karate, was:
	- *"When I train with him, he always says: Stick it! Tolerate it! Take it, be patient, and wait! But wait for one punch that will obliterate your adversary."*
		- Why waiting for the right moment is powerful and beneficial?
			- Because waiting in the world of constant haste can lead you to the realm of deep thinking. People always chase knowledge/books/ideas but they don't have enough time to process all these information.  They are not capable of it. There is  too much to assimilate.
			- That's why we need *¬´ digital realm where information can be molded and shaped and directed to any purpose, like a magical, primordial force of nature ¬ª*.[^1] 
			- *¬´ Digital app is a tool to extend out thinking beyond the bound of out skull. ¬ª* [^2]
