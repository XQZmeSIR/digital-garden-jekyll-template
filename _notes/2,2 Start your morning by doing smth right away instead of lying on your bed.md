When you wake up, force your brain to do something right away. Do not hesitate, do not take your phone, do not create an illusion of doing something. [[2,1 First thing you do sets the tone of the rest of the day]]

You shouldn't allow your brain to decide what it wants to do. It's something like creating a fixed routine that frees and saves your willpower for further work.([[Journal entry for 4 March 2024]])  

The morning might look like this:
- Woke up
- 20 push-ups
- Knee or ankle strengthening
- Freshen yourself up
- `Some activity: pack your volleyball pack; uni pack`
- Breakfast and a cup of Coffee
