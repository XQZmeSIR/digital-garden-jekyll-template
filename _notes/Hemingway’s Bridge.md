**Hemingway‚Äôs Bridge** is a strategy greatly applicable to writing.
The central idea is to create a bridge for yourself between writing sessions or productive sprints.

Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:

**Write down ideas for next steps**: At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one. Works like [[2,9 –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞ ‚Äî –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–± —Å–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–æ—á–∏—Ç—å—Å—è]] that saves you from deciding what to do, that can be unproductive.

**Write down the current status**: Write down what‚Äôs top of mind at the moment that you want to defer till the next day. Your current plot you are developing or challenge/open question you‚Äôre trying to deal with in text.

**Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away**: Such as details about similar examples in your life that you want to include in your stories. Your right-now thoughts about some detail you want to elaborate. 

**Write out your intention for the next work session**: Set an intention for what you plan on grappling with next. What you want to solve as soon as you start your next session of [[Deep Work]]. Works like aforementioned [[2,9 –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞ ‚Äî –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–± —Å–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–æ—á–∏—Ç—å—Å—è]] but now you can set more task according to [[2,7 –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ —Ç—Ä–µ—Ö –¥–µ–ª]].
