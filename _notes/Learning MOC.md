> [!own] How can I apply this?
> When finishing Anki study session — try to actively recall those 20 words. Write them down in a notebook in any order AND if possible, write one sentence with them.
> 
> As for not just cards, the framework is:
> - Encounter a topic
> - Familiarizing with the topic
> - **The retrieval practice(RP) itself**. Force yourself to recall what you remember. Make this process effort-consuming.
> - Identify the gaps in your understanding by returning to the material. *See also:* [[The Feynman Technique]]
> - **Repeat the act of RP** with a spaced out interval to ensure that [[spacing effect]] is also used.
