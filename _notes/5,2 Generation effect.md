![[Restate an idea in your own words to truly learn it. - Fork My Brain#^e29151]]

The generation effect is a phenomenon in cognitive psychology that states that producing our own material and [[Do your own thinking]] stimulates better understanding and retention of the material. It is sort of a bridge or a tool that helps for [[5,1 Internalization of knowledge]]

It is basically the term/finding that explains why *writing using your own words* was promoted so vigorously in [[Zettelkasten]] and Knowledge management communities. Itâ€™s like when you are being taught something that is supposed to be effective, but you donâ€™t know yet why? And then you encounter a concept that explains the reason.

In an [episode of Hubermanâ€™s podcast with Cal Newport](https://youtu.be/mzexJPoXBCM?si=elvZi__jDBwixVDU) as a guest, they discussed [[Active Recall, Testing effect, Retrieval practice]] and Cal said: 

>*Replicating the information from scratch as if teaching a class without looking at your notes. â€” Cal Newport*

And although he was talking about Active recall, this actually applies and perfectly describes Generation effect. Supposedly they go along in a sense. Because GE involves ==retrieving==, ==integrating== it into [[Prior Knowledge]] and then ==replicating== information using your own words.

**Where X comes from**? I first encounter the term **Generation effect** in a digital garden that belongs to Anne-Laure Le Cunff, the founder of NessLab. Then, watching Nick Miloâ€™s I learned more about this concept.


**It reminds me of** [[Do your own thinking]] and [[Active Recall, Testing effect, Retrieval practice]].

**It is similar to** [[Restate an idea in your own words to truly learn it. - Fork My Brain]] that states the same. Use your own words.

**It is the opposite of** just using copy-paste approach in [[The NoMa Method]] which is just pointless activity of collecting staff. In other words, [[Collectorâ€™s Fallacy]].

**It is relevant because** it gives you an awareness of how to actually learn things, and not to be the victim of [[Illusion of Knowledge]], [[The Illusion of busyness]], [[Illusion of Competence]]
