- **Greg McKeown**, the author of two New York Times bestsellers, [**_Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_**](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown-ebook/dp/B00G1J1D28/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20) and [**_Effortless: Make It Easier to Do What Matters Most_**](https://www.amazon.com/Effortless-Make-Easier-What-Matters/dp/0593135644/?tag=offsitoftimfe-20) choose:
	- 1 top priority task([[2,5 Преследуй истинно важные цели|истинно важная цель]])
		- Normally, this should be [[2,5 Преследуй истинно важные цели|истинно важная цель]] like learning Python(in my case) or starting doing business cuz only this can make me financially independent.
	- 2 essential yet urgent tasks(_that have deadline_)
	- 3 maintenance tasks(_anything that if I don't do it it's not important today but if I don't do it it will make life a lot harder later: Anki, Reading, Working out, Note-making in Obsidian_)

The 1-2-3 method involves setting aside time every Sunday morning to review and prioritize tasks for the week. Additionally, the speaker employs a daily planning method where they write down the most essential task for the day, two essential yet urgent tasks, and three maintenance items. This method helps the speaker stay focused on what truly matters and organizes their daily priorities effectively.
