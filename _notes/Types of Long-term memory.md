In psychology, there are considered to be two types of long-term memory: **explicit** and **implicit memory.**  

**The first one(explicit)** includes things you have to **consciously** recall or those that are brought into awareness through associations. There are two types of explicit memory with the first one being **semantic memory** (smth that we usually learn and practice deliberately) and the second **episodic memory** (autobiographical events or experience through which we went through and memorized it naturally)  
  
- **The second one(implicit)** includes things that you remember **unconsciously** and **automatically** with repetition([[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]]). Usually non-verbal memories. This type of memory also branches off into two others: 
	- **emotional** (the emotions you felt during an experience; [[Pavlov's conditioned reflex]], Ordeals in life)
	- and **procedural**  (the memory of how to performance task without actively thinking).
		- When we repeat the same action it becomes more efficient, therefore our neurons fire and strengthen([[Hebbâ€™s Law]]) that miraculously cause spending less effort on this action. So whatever you do once, is easier to do a second time([[Embodied cognition]]) ^d824d2
