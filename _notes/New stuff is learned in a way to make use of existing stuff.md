When you learn something new, you collect information and make sense of it afterward. **If you know something related, your brain will make use of existing information to speed up the process.**

This can be called **assimilation**: new stuff is learned in a way to make use of existing stuff. Existing neural pathways are used. This is the case when you learn the first words of a new language: you translate and remember.

Then there‚Äôs the mode of **accommodation**, where we start to adapt and change the way we think to better understand the object of our interest. That‚Äôs when you can let go of your first language to understand the new one. However, It can be a more difficult and painful process on account of its difficulty to accept and rethink your pre-existent beliefs.

	- *¬´ Our brains work not that differently in terms of interconnectedness. Psychologists used to think of the brain as a limited storage space that slowly fills up and makes it more difficult to learn late in life. **But we know today that the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information**. Yes, **our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age**. ==But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas==, or ‚Äúlatticework of mental models‚Äù (Munger, 1994), ==it becomes easier to make sense of new information==. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed.* ¬ª
