Establish trust with yourself.
If you said you'd do it, do it, otherwise your control of yourself will be degrading as time passes. Once you developed [[Discipline]] the next time you need to do something, youâ€™ll be sure that there is nothing to worry about because you trust yourself, and youâ€™ll get things done.
