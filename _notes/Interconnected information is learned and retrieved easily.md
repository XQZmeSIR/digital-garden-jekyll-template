We can learn and assimilate new information more quickly when it is interconnected. This is because each new layer of information builds upon the previously known information, gradually increasing its magnitude. [[New stuff is learned in a way to make use of existing stuff]].

Things that we learn are going through [[Assimilation and Accommodation]].
And ultimately it creates a network of ideas or *latticework of mental models* (Munger, 1994), which enhances learning and information retrieval. ^d9b47e

That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later at the moment and context it is needed.
